# JS-Fractals

__JS-Fractals__ is a project I started in my third year of computer science for a computer graphics course and is based entirely on javascript.

The repository contains different fractals that each have their own customizable properties 
that the user can interact with through a basic html interface.  

To run a fractal, simply open the index.html of the folder with the same name.
